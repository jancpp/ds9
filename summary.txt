Lab6 â€“ Summary

During experimental profiling on open hash table with chaining, closed hast table with quadratic probing, and closed hash table with double hashing, I tested performance of the hash tables. I measured time in milliseconds.
During insert/built, the open hast table performed faster than both closed hash table. Both closed hash tables had very similar performance during insert.
During find operation, all three tables performed very similarly, the closed table with double hashing has a slight edge. Even with larger amounts of data, all tables found value almost instantly, very close to O(1).
